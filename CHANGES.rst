Changes of the original *let*:

1.0.1 (Feb 25, 2016)
--------------------
- Let now assigns the variables to the global namespace always - never
  the local namespace. The Python interpreter sometimes optimizes variables
  within the local namespace - it's best not to change values behind its
  back, as it leads to very difficult to discover bugs.

1.0.0 (Feb. 7, 2016)
--------------------
- Initial commit
